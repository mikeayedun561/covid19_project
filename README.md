Did data analysis on COVID-19 pandemic

Summary:Developed learning algorithms to analyze the COVID19 pandemic. Used clustering algorithms KMEans to cluster groups based on deaths to find areas that were most likely to experience deaths.
Forecasted the trend for number of cases and deaths from COVID19 using time series analysis. Productionize and deployed a Regression model that predicts the numbers of deaths given the number of cases and location
using the Flask Framework in python.

Motivation: The goal was to find which areas in the United States were most likely to experience deaths and to also observed the continued trend of the number deaths and cases due to COVID19.

Outcome: I was able to cluster counties/states based on the number of deaths. Developed a model that approximates the number of deaths given the location and number of cases.
